# RoadSignRecognition
Python final project
## ToDo List
- [x] Choose technologies
- [x] Preprocess DB
- [x] Recognition of road sign type
- [x] Statistics
- [x] Labels
- [ ] Road sign detection

## Description
There are four different models of CNN network. We all used keras library to train our database, but we chose different approaches to build convolution network and sometimes use different data augmentation. Each model was evaluated and the best one was used to prepare program which recognise input picture and return name of the road sing.      

## Dataset

## Keras 

## Comparison of different models

## Evaluation of our models

## Detection od road signs
